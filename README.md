# safecracker

TODO: add description of puzzle and photo.

This is a script to solve the Safecracker 50 puzzle.

I was given this puzzle and solved it with a combination of thinking, trial-and-error and python code.

## Setup using miniconda/anaconda

```bash
conda create --name safecracker
conda activate safecracker
conda install numpy
python safecracker.py
```
